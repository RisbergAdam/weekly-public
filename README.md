# Weekly

Weekly is a mobile application that enables users to collaboratively manage shopping lists. The application will synchronize the state of a shoppling list in real time between clients connected to the same workspace over websockets using ShareDB. The application has three major software components: a react native app (located in the /weeklyapp folder), a kotlin REST API (located in the /backend folder)  and a nodejs websocket service (located in the /share folder).
